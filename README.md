# xkcd-downloader

This is a simple script that will download a random xkcd comic to the same directory of the script. It will first get the number of the most recent comic so we know the max number to use, then pick a random number between 1 and that number and download that image.

You could enhance this further and get the description or alt text of the image, but that was not necessary for my purposes.
